## 🌟 Overview

AniJikan is a full-stack anime tracking application that combines data from three major anime APIs (MyAnimeList, AniList, and Jikan) to deliver a unified and blazing-fast experience. 

Designed with an offline-first philosophy, AniJikan utilizes browser local storage as a quick-read cache for instantaneous UI interactions (such as updating scores or episode counts), while coordinating behind the scenes via a queue-based background synchronization worker to persist data to MyAnimeList.

---

## 🤖 AI Collaboration & Project Evolution

AniJikan is a prime example of human-AI developer synergy:

- **The Core Foundation**: The entire initial application architecture, UI layout, routing schema, and third-party API integration layers were designed and built manually by its original developer, **[Zikri](https://github.com/Zikri809)**.
- **The Modern Iteration**: The subsequent platform-wide modernization—including migrating the codebase from Next.js Pages Router to the App Router structure, a complete conversion to strict TypeScript, setting up the testing harness (Vitest and Playwright), hardening OAuth authentication cookies, and configuring CI automation pipelines—was co-authored and implemented in collaboration with **Codex** and **Antigravity** (an advanced agentic AI coding assistant developed by Google DeepMind).

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Authentication
* **MyAnimeList OAuth2 with PKCE**: Fully secure OAuth login flow utilizing Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) to prevent interception attacks.
* **Intelligent Background Refresh**: Dedicated API route automatically refreshes user access tokens 2 days before expiry to preserve long-term session continuity without user interruption.
* **Detailed User Dashboard**: Real-time rendering of MyAnimeList profiles, including user statistics, avatars, and top-rated entries.

### 📺 Watchlist & State Management
* **Dual-State Sync**: Instant visual response on the client via `localStorage` paired with eventual-consistency background sync to MyAnimeList via custom API proxies.
* **Conflict-Free State Transitions**: Mutually exclusive watchlist states (e.g., adding an anime to *Completed* automatically prunes it from *Watching* or *Plan to Watch* to avoid database conflicts).
* **Granular Tracking**: Update watched episode counts, assign scores (0-10), and change watch states via interactive forms.
* **Offline Resiliency**: Unsaved sync actions are queued locally if the user loses connectivity and are retried sequentially once online.

### 🗓️ Deep Seasonal Browsing
* **Automatic Season Detection**: Dynamic, server-side algorithm detects the current season based on the calendar month and system time.
* **Extended 11-Season Carousel**: Navigate seamlessly across a temporal span of 11 seasons (4 past seasons, the current season, the upcoming season, and 5 future/scheduled seasons).
* **Multi-Criteria Sorting & Filtering**: Sort seasonal lists by average score, popularity, members, or release date.

### 🔍 Advanced Search & Discovery
* **AniList GraphQL Integration**: A trending carousel showcases high-resolution banner images and current popular shows fetched via the AniList GraphQL engine.
* **Sanitized Query Search**: Complete title search powered by Jikan, sanitizing input vectors to prevent URL breakages and escape characters.
* **Rich Detail Pages**: Comprehensive views featuring synopses, genre tags, scores, studio credits, video trailers, and direct anime sequels/prequels (relations).

### 🎨 Premium UI/UX Design
* **Glassmorphism & Dark Mode**: Sleek dark aesthetic designed with custom CSS variables and utility classes, utilizing `@shadcn/ui` and Radix accessibility primitives.
* **PWA & Mobile Optimization**: Mobile-first touch interactions, custom gestures (swipe to switch tabs), and Apple-specific splash screen media configurations.
* **Perceived Performance**: Component skeletons minimize loading jumps during async requests.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Data Sync Model

### 1. Dual-Sync Synchronization Engine
When a user updates an anime tracking status, the system runs a split-data flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User Input: Update Progress] --> LocalState[Update LocalState & LocalStorage]
    LocalState --> UI[Instant Optimistic UI Render]
    User --> PersistentWorker[Persistent Sync Worker]
    PersistentWorker --> Queue[Local Sync Queue]
    Queue --> OnlineCheck{Network Online?}
    OnlineCheck -- Yes --> APIProxy[Next.js API Route handler]
    OnlineCheck -- No --> Queue
    APIProxy --> MALAPI[MyAnimeList API v2]
    MALAPI -- Success --> SyncComplete[Confirm & Clear Local Sync Queue]
    MALAPI -- Token Expired --> TokenRefresh[Call Auth Refresh API]
    TokenRefresh --> APIProxy
```

* **Client Optimistic UI**: Changes are immediately stored in the browser's `localStorage` maps (`Watching`, `Completed`, `PlanToWatch`, `OnHold`, `Dropped`).
* **Non-Blocking Syncing**: The `persistent_worker` component continuously polls the sync queue to batch updates to our backend API proxy, eliminating page loading blocks.

### 2. High-Performance Caching & ISR
* **12-Hour Page Cache**: Public seasonal and anime detail data use a `revalidate` period of 43,200 seconds (12 hours) to respect Jikan and MAL API rate limits.
* **Crawler Protection**: Expensive route families reject known bulk crawlers, `robots.txt` exposes a deliberately small crawl surface, and production traffic is expected to be protected by Vercel Firewall rules.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js** 20.x or higher
* **npm** or **yarn** package manager
* **MyAnimeList API Keys**: Required for user synchronization.

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zikri809/AnimeTracker-Next-js.git
cd AnimeTracker-Next-js
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project:

| Variable | Example Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Client_ID` | `ab12cd34ef56...` | MyAnimeList App Client ID |
| `Client_Secret` | `xyz123...` | MyAnimeList App Client Secret |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_Local_host` | `http://localhost:3000/` | Local host domain with trailing slash |
| `Prod_host` | `https://your-app.vercel.app/` | Production Vercel domain with trailing slash |
| `dev_auth_redirect` | `http://localhost:3000/api/users/auth/callback` | Redirect callback URL in development |
| `prod_auth_redirect`| `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/users/auth/callback`| Redirect callback URL in production |

#### 🔑 Registering MyAnimeList API Client:
1. Log in to [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) and head to **[API Panel](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig)**.
2. Create a new App Client. Select **web** as the application type.
3. Configure the **App Redirect URL** exactly to match your redirection route (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/api/users/auth/callback` for local testing).
4. Save client details and copy the generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret` into your `.env` file.

### 3. Spin up Server
To start the local Next.js hot-reloaded dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to preview the project.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

The codebase maintains a strict standard of testing before merge approval.

### Execution Scripts
Run these commands from the root directory:

* **`npm run test`** - Executes Vitest suite to test parsing, season offsets, and storage hooks.
* **`npm run test:watch`** - Opens Vitest UI/Watcher mode.
* **`npm run test:e2e`** - Triggers Playwright tests to perform UI interactions, search journeys, and authentication redirects.
* **`npm run typecheck`** - Checks compilation validity under standard TypeScript.
* **`npm run lint`** - Analyzes code formatting and pattern compliance.
* **`npm run verify`** - Triggers the sequential pipeline of lint, typecheck, unit tests, and Playwright tests locally.

---

## 🚢 CI/CD & Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
This repository is configured for immediate deployment to Vercel:
1. Connect your repository to your Vercel Dashboard.
2. Input all required production environment variables (`Client_ID`, `Client_Secret`, `Prod_host`, `prod_auth_redirect`).
3. Ensure the project root and install commands are left as default.

### GitHub Actions Workflows
* **Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)**: Automatically triggers on all pull requests and pushes to `main`. It initializes a Node 20 environment, installs dependencies, verifies code linting/formatting, checks TypeScript types, compiles the build, and executes both unit tests and headless Playwright tests.
* **Production traffic controls**: Follow [`docs/vercel-crawler-protection.md`](docs/vercel-crawler-protection.md) before attaching a public custom domain.
